# Designer Regular Font

This directory should contain the Designer Regular font files:

- Designer-Regular.woff2
- Designer-Regular.woff

## Instructions:

1. Purchase or download the Designer Regular font from a legitimate source
2. Convert it to web formats (WOFF2 and WOFF) using a tool like FontSquirrel's Webfont Generator
3. Place the converted files in this directory

Note: Until the actual font files are added, the system will fall back to system fonts as defined in the CSS.
