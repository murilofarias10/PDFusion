# Fonts Directory

This directory should contain the following font files:
- Designer-Regular.woff
- Designer-Regular.woff2

These fonts are used in the styles.css file. 

If you don't have these specific fonts, you can:
1. Add them to this directory if you have the files
2. Modify the CSS to use different fonts
3. The site will still work with system fallback fonts

For the GitHub Pages demo, the site will use system fonts if these files are not present.
